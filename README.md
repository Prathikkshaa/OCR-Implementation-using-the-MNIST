Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the MNIST Dataset
Overview
This project showcases the implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9) that is widely used for training and testing image processing systems. The dataset includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing, each represented as a 28x28 grayscale pixel grid.

Using TensorFlow, I have developed and trained a neural network model designed to recognize these digits accurately. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for feature extraction and classification in OCR tasks.

Features
MNIST Dataset: Utilizes the standard MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Implements a CNN architecture with multiple layers for efficient feature extraction and classification.
TensorFlow: Employs TensorFlow, a leading machine learning library, to build, train, and evaluate the model.
High Accuracy: The trained model achieves high accuracy on the test set, effectively recognizing handwritten digits.
